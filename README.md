# Covid19 Metrics

> Space Travelers' Hub is single-page application (SPA) that showcases Covid19 data for one hundred and ninety five(195) countries. The data being showcased was fetched from the [Narrativa API](https://covid19tracking.narrativa.com/index_en.html). The fetched data is being displayed in cards on the `Home` page, while data for each country's region is being displayed on the `Details` page. Countries with empty regional data display an informative text to tell users about the unavailable regional data. Every page has a unique route within the SPA.
